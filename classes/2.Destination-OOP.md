    - Verify that you can add `Plane` objects to the planes array using `addPlane`.
3. In `Plane.js`, create code that meets the following specifications:
    - **Properties**
        - `name`: The name of the Airport.
        - `airportCode`: A static property with the three letter code for the airport (e.g. JFK or LHR).
        - `planes`: An array of `Plane` objects currently at the airport. Initializes as an empty array.
    - **Methods**
        - `getPlanes()`: Returns the array of `planes`.
        - `addPlane(plane)`: Adds the `plane` to the `planes` array. 
4. Verify your tests work by running `npm test ./__tests__/classes/Airport.test.js`.
